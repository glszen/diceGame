# Dice Game - React

A simple Dice Game built using React. Players roll two dice, and the program determines the winner based on the results. The game displays a rolling animation for the dice and reveals the winner after a short delay.

## Features

- **Dice Animation**: The dice images animate as they roll for 2 seconds before revealing the final result.
- **Game Logic**: Compares the results of two dice rolls (Player 1 vs PC) to determine the winner.
- **Responsive UI**: Simple layout that works well on different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Bootstrap** (Optional): For UI components (e.g., buttons, grids).
- **Images**: Custom dice images (dice1.png, dice2.png, dice3.png, etc.).
