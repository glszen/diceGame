# Dice Game - React

A simple Dice Game built using React where the user can change the name of "Player 1" dynamically and roll the dice. The game displays an animated dice roll for 2 seconds before revealing the winner.

## Features

- **Dynamic Player Names**: Player 1’s name can be changed by typing into an input field.
- **Dice Animation**: The dice images continuously change for 2 seconds before revealing the final result.
- **Game Logic**: The game compares the results of the dice rolls (Player 1 vs PC) to determine the winner.
- **Responsive UI**: The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Bootstrap** (Optional): For UI components (e.g., buttons, grids).
- **Images**: Custom dice images (`dice1.png`, `dice2.png`, `dice3.png`, etc.).
